        Looks the index up per the collection lookup mechanics without modifying the collection.

        containers, expected O(log n) for tree-based containers.

      description="""
        Returns an owned copy of the element associated with the index - use `view` when
        the copy is not needed. The cost matches the underlying implementation: expected
        O(1) for hash-based and direct-indexed containers, expected O(log n) for tree-based containers.

      description="""
        Returns a pointer to the element associated with the index without copying it.
        The view is valid while the entry is held by the collection - removing it or overwriting
        the element at the index invalidates the view. The cost matches the underlying
        implementation: expected O(1) for hash-based and direct-indexed containers, expected O(log n) for tree-based containers.
