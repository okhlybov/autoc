# Property mixin for containers whose iteration order is born sorted - the ascending
# element (or index) order is an invariant of the structure itself, not a user-maintained
# state (that is Sortable's regime), so backward traversal is available unconditionally.
# Claimed by the tree and flat sets, and by the map families keyed over them. Unordered
# containers (the hash-based families) do not claim it; their iteration order is layout-
# incidental. Unlike the ability mixins (the -able family) a property is also the shape
# of a requirement: a composite keyed over such a component demands the property of it
# and validates the demand at its own construction time via require(). The property owns
# its invariant: every claiming container has the orderability of its ordering subject
# enforced here, in one place.
